DJ Turntable v1.0.0
===================

Dj Turntable is demonstration of integrating Qt Quick application to Qt audio
interface. Application is compatible with Symbian^3 devices with Qt 4.7.0 or
higher.


FILES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

src/main.cpp

- Creates all needed Qt objects and initializes the Declarative runtime.
  Integration of the QML and Qt code is done here.
  
src/TurnTable.h
src/TurnTable.cpp

- Represents the logic of the turntable section of the UI. Turntable object
  contains the main audio mixer to which the drum beats and the the disc sample
  is mixed.
  
src/DrumMachine.h
src/DrumMachine.cpp

- Represents the logic of the drum machine section of the UI. Signals of the 
  drum machine QML are mapped directly to this objects slots. Storing / loading
  of the drum sequences are done here.

src/accelerometerfilter.h

- Handles the accelerometer information from the devices sensor. The signals
  about the accelerometer data change are mapped directly to the QML slots to
  rotate the reflection on turntables disc.
  
src/sounds/*

- Contains all of the samples used by Dj Turntable.
  
src/qml/DrumMachine/*

- QML files containing UI controls of the Drum Machine.

src/qml/InfoScreen/*

- QML files containing UI controls of the Info Screen.

src/qml/TurnTable.qml

- The main qml file that represents as the whole UI of the application.
  All else qml files / elements are children of this file.

install/

- The compiled binaries.


KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The application is not yet optimized for the Maemo devices. Maemo support
  will be published later.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile device (S60 5th Edition and Symbian^3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to install the application in the device.

0. The Qt 4.7.0 or higher libraries must be installed, see COMPATIBILITY
   chapter for more information about the install.

1. a) Drag the install/qtquickplayground.sis file to the Nokia Ovi Suite when
      phone is connected with the USB cable.
   
   OR
   
   b) Send the application directly to the Messaging Inbox (for example,
      through Bluetooth).

2. After the installation is complete, return to the Application menu and
   select the Applications folder.
   
3. Locate the qtquickplayground icon and select it to launch the application.



RUNNING THE APPLICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dj Turntable is demonstration of integrating Qt Quick application to Qt audio interface.

Turntable

Play the looping sample with a realistic turntable. The sample can be scratched by the finger, played faster, slower and backwards. The speed of the disk can be adjusted with the speed slider, the default 1x speed can be obtained by double clicking the speed slider knob. Dj Turntable offers Cutoff and Resonance to alternate the sample in real time. The knobs are rotated by moving the finger up and down on top of the knobs.

Drum machine
                      
Play and edit the drum beats. There are four predefined beats which can be played and edited but the edits are not stored. For the user there are four beats that are saved to the devices memory whenever they are edited. Use the beat selector on the bottom right corner of the view to iterate through the beats. All the beats are 32 ticks long and they accommondate 6 different drum samples: hi-hat, hi-hat open, bass drum, snare, cymbal and cow bell.

Keyboard shortcuts

There exists following keyboard shortcuts:
Camera zoom up = Volume up
Camera zoom down = Volume down
Space = Start / stop turntable
Return = Start / stop drum machine
Key up = Go to turntable view
Key down = Go to drum machine view
Key left = View the 1st tick group in drum machine
Key right = View the 2nd tick group in drum machine
Key i = Go to info view


Samples

The turntable melody sample ivory.wav was created by nick Flick3r and it was downloaded from http://www.freesound.org. The sample follows the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/ license.



COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Symbian^3 with Qt version 4.7.0 or higher.

  1. Download the Qt 4.7.0 or higher for Symbian from qt.nokia.com
  
  2. Drag the qt_installer.sis on top of the device in Nokia Ovi Suite while
     the device is connected. The sis package is found from the installation
     folder of the Qt 4.7.0 or higher for Symbian.

     
    
Tested on:

- Nokia N8
- Nokia E7
