DJ Turntable v1.1.0
===================

Dj Turntable demonstrates integrating a Qt Quick application to the Qt audio
interface. The application is compatible with Symbian^3 devices with Qt 4.7.1
or higher, Maemo devices with Qt 4.7.0, and Windows desktop computers starting 
with Windows XP (the Qt libraries are provided with the executable).


FILES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

src/main.cpp

- Creates all the required Qt objects and initialises the Declarative runtime.
  The integration of the QML and Qt code is done here.
  
src/TurnTable.h
src/TurnTable.cpp

- Represents the logic of the turntable section of the UI. The Turntable 
  object contains the main audio mixer to which the drum beats and the disc 
  sample are mixed.
  
src/DrumMachine.h
src/DrumMachine.cpp

- Represents the logic of the drum machine section of the UI. Signals of the 
  drum machine QML are mapped directly to this object's slots. The storing and 
  loading of the drum sequences is done here.

src/accelerometerfilter.h

- Handles the accelerometer information from the device's sensor. The signals
  about changes in accelerometer data are mapped directly to the QML slots to 
  rotate the reflection on the record on the turntable.
  
src/sounds/*

- Contains the audio samples used by DJ Turntable.
  
src/qml/DrumMachine/*

- QML files containing the UI controls of the drum machine.

src/qml/InfoScreen/*

- QML files containing the UI controls of the info screen.

src/qml/TurnTable.qml

- The main QML file that represents the whole UI of the application.
  All other QML files and elements are children of this file.

install/

- The compiled binaries.


KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- There is currently some latency when playing audio in Symbian.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile device (Symbian^3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to install the application on the device.

0. The Qt libraries (4.7.1 or higher) must be installed. See the section

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DJ Turntable is a Forum Nokia example that demonstrates integrating a Qt Quick 
application to the Qt audio interface.

Turntable

Play the looping sample with a realistic turntable. The sample can be 
scratched with the finger, played faster, slower, and backwards. The speed of 
the record can be adjusted with the speed slider, the default 1x speed can be 
obtained by double-clicking the speed slider knob. DJ Turntable includes 
Cutoff and Resonance control knobs to alter the sample in real time. The knobs 
are rotated by moving a finger up and down on top of them.

Drum machine
                      
Play and edit the drum beats. There are three predefined beats which can be
played and edited but the edits are not stored. For the user there are three
beats that are saved to the device memory whenever they are edited. Use the
beat selector buttons in the bottom of the view to switch between the beats.
All the beats are 32 ticks long and they contain 6 different drum
samples: hi-hat, hi-hat open, bass drum, snare, cymbal, and cow bell.

Keyboard shortcuts

The following keyboard shortcuts exist:
Camera zoom up = Volume up
Camera zoom down = Volume down
Space = Start / stop the turntable
Return = Start / stop the drum machine
Key up = Go to the turntable view
Key down = Go to the drum machine view
Key left = View the 1st tick group in the drum machine
Key right = View the 2nd tick group in the drum machine
Key i = Go to the info view
Backspace = Return from the info view to the previous view
