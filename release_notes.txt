DJ Turntable v1.1.0
===================

Dj Turntable demonstrates integrating a Qt Quick application to Qt audio
interface. The application is compatible with Symbian^3 devices with Qt 4.7.1
or higher, Maemo devices with Qt 4.7.0 and Windows desktop computers starting
with Windows XP (the Qt libraries are provided with executable).


FILES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

src/main.cpp

- Creates all needed Qt objects and initializes the Declarative runtime.
  Integration of the QML and Qt code is done here.
  
src/TurnTable.h
src/TurnTable.cpp

- Represents the logic of the turntable section of the UI. Turntable object
  contains the main audio mixer to which the drum beats and the disc sample
  is mixed.
  
src/DrumMachine.h
src/DrumMachine.cpp

- Represents the logic of the drum machine section of the UI. Signals of the 
  drum machine QML are mapped directly to this object's slots. Storing /
  loading of the drum sequences are done here.

src/accelerometerfilter.h

- Handles the accelerometer information from the device's sensor. The signals
  about the accelerometer data change are mapped directly to the QML slots to
  rotate the reflection on the turntable's disc.
  
src/sounds/*

- Contains all of the audio samples used by Dj Turntable.
  
src/qml/DrumMachine/*

- QML files containing UI controls of the Drum Machine.

src/qml/InfoScreen/*

- QML files containing UI controls of the Info Screen.

src/qml/TurnTable.qml

- The main QML file that represents the whole UI of the application.
  All other QML files and elements are children of this file.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile device (Symbian^3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to install the application into the device.

0. The Qt 4.7.1 or higher libraries must be installed, see COMPATIBILITY
   chapter for more information about the installation.

1. a) Drag the turntable.sis file to the Nokia Ovi Suite when
      the phone is connected with the USB cable.
   
   OR
   
   b) Send the application directly to the Messaging Inbox (for example,
      through Bluetooth).

2. After the installation is complete, return to the Application menu and
   select the Applications folder.
   
3. Locate the turntable icon and select it to launch the application.


Maemo device
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mobile device (Maemo)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
0. The Qt 4.7.0 or higher libraries must be installed, see COMPATIBILITY
   chapter for more information about the install.

1. Copy the turntable_1.1.0_armel.deb file into a
   specific folder of the device (for example "MyDocs").

2. Start the XTerm. Type "sudo gainroot" to get root access.

3. "cd" into the directory to which you copied the package (e.g. "cd MyDocs").

4. As root, install the package:
   "dpkg -i turntable_1.1.0_armel.deb".

5. Launch the Applications menu.

6. Locate the Dj Turntable icon and select it to launch the application.


Windows desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Extract the turntable.zip to the folder of your choosing

2. Launch the application from turntable.exe.



RUNNING THE APPLICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dj Turntable is a Forum Nokia example that demonstrates integrating a Qt Quick
application to Qt audio interface.

Turntable

Play the looping sample with a realistic turntable. The sample can be scratched
with the finger, played faster, slower and backwards. The speed of the disk can
be adjusted with the speed slider, the default 1x speed can be obtained by
double clicking the speed slider knob. Dj Turntable offers Cutoff and Resonance
to alternate the sample in real time. The knobs are rotated by moving the
finger up and down on top of the knobs.

Drum machine
                      
Play and edit the drum beats. There are three predefined beats which can be
played and edited but the edits are not stored. For the user there are three
beats that are saved to the device memory whenever they are edited. Use the
beat selector buttons on the bottom of the view to switch between the beats.
All the beats are 32 ticks long and they contain 6 different drum
samples: hi-hat, hi-hat open, bass drum, snare, cymbal and cow bell.

Keyboard shortcuts

The following keyboard shortcuts exist:
Camera zoom up = Volume up
Camera zoom down = Volume down
Space = Start / stop the turntable
Return = Start / stop the drum machine
Key up = Go to the turntable view
Key down = Go to the drum machine view
Key left = View the 1st tick group in the drum machine
Key right = View the 2nd tick group in the drum machine
Key i = Go to the info view
Backspace = Return from the info view to the previous view

COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Symbian^3 with Qt version 4.7.1 or higher.

  1. Download the Qt 4.7.1 or higher for Symbian from qt.nokia.com
  
  2. Drag the qt_installer.sis on top of the device in Nokia Ovi Suite while
     the device is connected. The sis package is found from the installation
     folder of the Qt 4.7.1 or higher for Symbian.
     
     
- Maemo with PR1.3 which includes Qt 4.7.0

  1. Use Nokia Ovi Suite for updating the devices firmware to PR1.3

  
- Windows desktop, the needed Qt libraries are provided with the
  turntable binary.
    
    
Tested on:

- Nokia N8
- Nokia E7
